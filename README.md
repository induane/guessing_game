# Guessing Game
## Rust Practice

This is a simple version of the guessing game from the 
Rust Book - part of my process of learning Rust.

### TODO:
* Break out into a couple functions
* Make the command line interface look nicer for practice
* Accept more exit variations (using an array or something)
* Add optional "max guesses" option
* Optionally read configuration values from a config file
* Accept some command line switches (maybe resetting configs)
